<h1>Upgrade to SpeakOut! Pro</h1>
<div>
    <p>To support further development of the SpeakOut! plugin, there is now a Pro version for a one-off lifetime price.</p>  <p>The free version will still have a lot of functionality, I want it to work for groups that don't have any funds.  But for the full feature list, you will need to upgrade.</p>
